To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: BCLK, LRCLK, SDATA_O, SDATA_I, gpio_tri_io[1:0], iic_1_scl_io, iic_1_sda_io, gpio2_tri_i[0], FCLK_CLK1.
